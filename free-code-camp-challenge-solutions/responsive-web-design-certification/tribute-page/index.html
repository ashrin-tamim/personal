    <h3 id="headline">Here's a summary of the biography of Ibn Sina:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Early life and education</strong> Avicenna was born in c. 980 in
        the village of Afshana in Transoxiana to a family of Persian stock.[26]
        The village was near the Samanid capital of Bukhara, which was his
        mother's hometown. His father Abd Allah was a native of the city of
        Balkh in Tukharistan. An official of the Samanid bureaucracy, he had
        served as the governor of a village of the royal estate of Harmaytan
        (near Bukhara) during the reign of Nuh II (r. 976–997). Avicenna also
        had a younger brother. A few years later, the family settled in Bukhara,
        a centre of learning, which attracted many scholars.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In Bukhara and Gurganj</strong> t the age of seventeen, Avicenna
        was made a physician of Nuh II. By the time Avicenna was at least 21
        years old, his father died. He was subsequently given an administrative
        post, possibly succeeding his father as the governor of Harmaytan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In Gurgan</strong> Avicenna later moved due to "necessity" once
        more (in 1012), this time to the west. There he travelled through the
        Khurasani cities of Nasa, Abivard, Tus, Samangan and Jajarm. He was
        planning to visit the ruler of the city of Gurgan, the Ziyarid Qabus (r.
        977–981, 997–1012), a cultivated patron of writing, whose court
        attracted many distinguished poets and scholars.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In Ray and Hamadan</strong> In c. 1014, Avicenna went to the
        city of Ray, where he entered into the service of the Buyid amir (ruler)
        Majd al-Dawla (r. 997–1029) and his mother Sayyida Shirin, the de facto
        ruler of the realm. There he served as the physician at the court,
        treating Majd al-Dawla, who was suffering from melancholia.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In Isfahan</strong> Avicenna was subsequently released, and went
        to Isfahan, where he was well received by Ala al-Dawla. In the words of
        Juzjani, the Kakuyid ruler gave Avicenna "the respect and esteem which
        someone like him deserved."[29] Adamson also says that Avicenna's
        service under Ala al-Dawla "proved to be the most stable period of his
        life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Philosophy</strong> Avicenna wrote extensively on early Islamic
        philosophy, especially the subjects logic, ethics and metaphysics,
        including treatises named Logic and Metaphysics. Most of his works were
        written in Arabic—then the language of science in the Middle East—and
        some in Persian.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metaphysical doctrine</strong> Early Islamic philosophy and
        Islamic metaphysics, imbued as it is with Islamic theology,
        distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and
        existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the
        accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Argument for God's existence</strong> - Avicenna made an
        argument for the existence of God which would be known as the "Proof of
        the Truthful" (Arabic: burhan al-siddiqin). Avicenna argued that there
        must be a "necessary existent" (Arabic: wajib al-wujud), an entity that
        cannot not exist[70] and through a series of arguments, he identified it
        with the Islamic conception of God. varieties for each major climate on
        Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Al-Biruni correspondence</strong> - Correspondence between
        Avicenna (with his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi) and Al-Biruni has
        survived in which they debated Aristotelian natural philosophy and the
        Peripatetic school. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen
        questions, ten of which were criticisms of Aristotle's On the Heavens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Theology</strong> Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to
        reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. His aim was to
        prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically
        and through reason and logic.[73] Avicenna's views on Islamic theology
        (and philosophy) were enormously influential, forming part of the core
        of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thought experiments</strong> While he was imprisoned in the
        castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous "floating
        man"—literally falling man—a thought experiment to demonstrate human
        self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Canon of Medicine</strong>Avicenna authored a five-volume
        medical encyclopedia: The Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanun fi't-Tibb). It was
        used as the standard medical textbook in the Islamic world and Europe up
        to the 18th century.[85][86] The Canon still plays an important role in
        Unani medicine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Liber Primus Naturalium</strong> Avicenna considered whether
        events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes.[88] He used
        the example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons
        exist for all medical events. This view of medical phenomena anticipated
        developments in the Enlightenment by seven centuries

        <strong>The Book of Healing</strong> Avicenna considered whether events
        like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes.[88] He used the
        example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons
        exist for all medical events. This view of medical phenomena anticipated
        developments in the Enlightenment by seven centuries
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Philosophy of science</strong> In the Al-Burhan (On
        Demonstration) section of The Book of Healing, Avicenna discussed the
        philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of
        inquiry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Logic</strong> An early formal system of temporal logic was
        studied by Avicenna.[92] Although he did not develop a real theory of
        temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between temporalis
        and the implication.[93] Avicenna's work was further developed by Najm
        al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and became the dominant system of Islamic
        logic until modern times.
